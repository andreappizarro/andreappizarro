Recent research by Abascal, Flores, and García (2024) further reveals that Indigenous-language speakers had significantly lower COVID-19 vaccine uptake, citing fear and negative beliefs rather than access barriers as primary reasons for non-vaccination, despite overall high rates of vaccine availability (Abascal Miguel et al., 2024).\nThese studies provide important evidence about the barriers faced by Indigenous communities, but they typically treat the Indigenous population as internally homogeneous.

    "text": "Theory and Hypothesis\nLanguage is a fundamental determinant of access to public services, including healthcare. In Mexico, where the health system operates almost exclusively in Spanish, millions of Indigenous-language speakers face substantial barriers in navigating medical care. These barriers go beyond geographic or economic factors, but they are linguistic and structural. For individuals who speak only an Indigenous language, the inability to communicate in Spanish can hinder their ability to understand symptoms, follow medical instructions, or even complete basic administrative procedures.\nTheoretical frameworks in health access literature increasingly emphasize language as a structural determinant of healthcare engagement. Rather than acting solely as an individual-level characteristic, language proficiency shapes how people interact with institutions, mediates perceptions of trust, and filters who feels entitled to public resources. Garza and Miguel (2025) show that municipalities with larger populations of Indigenous-language speakers exhibit consistently lower levels of hospital access and use, even after controlling for income and rural status, suggesting that institutional presence alone is not sufficient to ensure equitable use (Garza & Miguel, 2025). Complementing this, Haimovich and Márquez Mora (2021) find that Nahuatl speakers in Puebla often avoid formal healthcare settings not because of geographic or financial barriers, but due to persistent linguistic mismatches with medical staff that erode trust and comprehension (Haimovich & Márquez Mora, 2021). These dynamics are not limited to general care: Abascal et al. (2024) document significantly lower COVID-19 vaccination rates among Indigenous-language speakers despite national availability, indicating that exclusion from dominant linguistic norms can affect even high-priority public health campaigns (Abascal Miguel et al., 2024). Together, these findings suggest that language operates not only as a barrier to access but as a broader gatekeeping mechanism within the healthcare system that shapes engagement, trust, and ultimately health outcomes.\nHowever, while these studies point to language as a barrier, they often treat Indigenous-language speakers as a single, homogenous group. This project builds on existing research by distinguishing between monolingual Indigenous-language speakers,those who do not speak Spanish, and bilingual speakers who do. This within-group comparison allows for a more precise examination of how language proficiency shapes healthcare behavior, particularly in settings where all respondents share Indigenous identity and cultural background. By holding cultural and ethnic identity relatively constant, the project aims to isolate language proficiency as a key variable influencing healthcare-seeking behavior. This approach offers two key advantages: First, it avoids confounding language with broader ethnic or geographic marginalization, which often varies between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations. Second, it recognizes the heterogeneity within Indigenous communities and acknowledges that Spanish fluency may confer greater institutional navigation skills, reduce communication barriers with providers, and increase perceived legitimacy within formal medical settings.\nImportantly, bilingual Indigenous speakers are not equivalent to monolingual Spanish speakers. Even though both groups can communicate in Spanish, bilingual Indigenous individuals often still face systemic discrimination, cultural distance, and institutional mistrust tied to their Indigenous identity. Comparing bilingual speakers to monolingual Spanish speakers could obscure the role that cultural belonging plays in shaping health outcomes. Instead, comparing bilingual and monolingual Indigenous speakers allows us to better understand the extent to which Spanish fluency alone improves access, without conflating it with differences in ethnicity or cultural experience. If bilingual individuals demonstrate significantly higher use of more formal healthcare services, even after controlling for income, insurance, and area type, it would provide compelling evidence that language itself, and not just associated structural factors, contributes to disparities in access.\nIn such a context, Spanish proficiency becomes a powerful divider. Bilingual speakers are more likely to navigate complex administrative systems, request services from multiple providers, and access higher-tier care. In contrast, monolingual speakers may rely on lower-tier services that are more accessible, familiar, or less administratively burdensome. These may include basic public clinics such as SSA centers and IMSS Bienestar units. Although these are part of the formal healthcare system, their administrative simplicity and geographic proximity make them more accessible to individuals with limited Spanish.\nThis theoretical perspective views language not only as a communication tool but as a mechanism of institutional accessibility. In the absence of Spanish proficiency, monolingual Indigenous speakers are structurally disadvantaged in their ability to access diverse, high-quality care. Their limited provider options may not reflect personal choice, but rather constrained access rooted in linguistic exclusion.\n\nHypothesis: Among Indigenous-language speakers in Mexico, individuals who do not speak Spanish (monolinguals) are more likely to rely on lower-tier or basic public healthcare services than bilingual speakers, due to the linguistic inaccessibility of more complex care institutions, indicating that language proficiency, beyond ethnic identity, produces meaningful within-group variation in access.\n\nThis hypothesis is both falsifiable and policy-relevant. If monolingual speakers are found to use a narrower and less institutionally diverse range of providers, it would suggest that improving language accessibility should be a central focus in addressing Indigenous health disparities. Policies such as expanded translation services, Indigenous-language outreach, and training of bilingual medical staff would be critical steps toward equitable care."

    "text": "Research Design\nThis analysis draws on data from the 2022 wave of the Encuesta Nacional de Salud y Nutrición Continua (ENSANUT), administered by Mexico’s Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP). ENSANUT is a nationally representative cross-sectional survey that uses a probabilistic, stratified sampling design to produce reliable health and demographic estimates at the national, regional, and urban/rural levels. The dataset includes rich information on healthcare usage, language use, education, household income, and access to insurance, making it suitable for examining how structural factors influence healthcare-seeking behavior (ensanut2022?).\nSignificant data cleaning was required to make the ENSANUT 2022 data analyzable. The raw files were initially formatted using inconsistent semicolon delimiters, which caused structural issues when importing, requiring manual inspection and correction of line breaks, column alignment, and malformed headers. In addition, variable labels were not standardized across files, necessitating manual relabeling and harmonization. Once the formatting was corrected, two distinct datasets—one at the individual level and one at the household level—had to be merged using a unique identifier. This step was further complicated by type mismatches and missing identifiers, which required additional transformations to align variable types and preserve complete observations for analysis. Beyond the research findings, a significant contribution of this project is the creation of a cleaner, more accessible version of ENSANUT data that can be reused for future analysis and exploration.\nThe unit of analysis of the ENSANUT is the individual respondent. For this study, the sample is restricted to adults aged 18 and older who report speaking an Indigenous language, using item H0311 (¿Habla alguna lengua indígena?/ Do you speak an Indigenous language?). While ENSANUT does not directly ask about ethnic identity, both INSP and Mexico’s national statistics agency (INEGI) routinely use Indigenous language use as a proxy for Indigenous identity in population-level studies (Villarreal, 2014). This approach is standard in health equity research and allows for robust analysis of intra-group differences within Indigenous populations.\nWithin this sample, respondents are divided into two groups using item H0312 (¿Habla también español?/ Do you also speak Spanish?): - Monolinguals: Speak an Indigenous language but not Spanish (H0311 = yes, H0312 = no). - Bilinguals: Speak both an Indigenous language and Spanish (H0311 = yes, H0312 = yes).\nA binary variable monolingual is created to distinguish these groups, coded as 1 for monolinguals and 0 for bilinguals. This distinction allows us to test whether the absence of Spanish proficiency, independent of shared Indigenous identity, influences patterns of healthcare access.\nThe dependent variable is the type of healthcare institution the respondent usually visits when facing a health need. Item H0309 asks: “Cuando tiene una necesidad de salud, ¿en dónde se atiende usualmente?”. When you have a health need, where do you usuakky seek care? The responses are grouped into a three-tier typology based on institutional complexity and accessibility: - Tier 1 (High-Complexity Institutional Care): IMSS, ISSSTE, PEMEX, Defense, private hospitals. - Tier 2 (Basic Public Care): SSA clinics, IMSS Bienestar, and DIF. - Tier 3 (Non-Institutional/Alternative Care): pharmacy consults, home-based care, traditional healers, homeopaths.\nThis project organizes reported healthcare use into a three-tier typology based on institutional complexity, formality, and accessibility. Tier 1 institutions: IMSS, ISSSTE, PEMEX, Defense hospitals, and private facilities—represent the most complex, well-resourced, and bureaucratically integrated parts of Mexico’s healthcare system, offering specialized care and requiring formal employment or affiliation for access (World Health Organization, 2020). Tier 2 includes SSA clinics, IMSS Bienestar, and DIF services, which are publicly funded, designed for the uninsured, and focus on basic care delivery in marginalized or rural communities (International Trade Administration, 2023). Tier 3 encompasses informal and non-institutional options such as pharmacy consults, traditional healers, homeopaths, and home-based care. These are often sought due to cultural preferences, affordability, or limited trust in formal providers and are particularly common in Indigenous communities (World Health Organization, 2020). This tiered framework is consistent with established public health literature on Mexico’s healthcare segmentation and allows for more nuanced analysis of how language and social vulnerability shape provider choice across institutional layers.\nFor the purposes of hypothesis testing, a binary variable tier2care is constructed: 1 if the respondent uses Tier 2 care, 0 if they use any other tier. Tier 2 institutions, such as SSA clinics and IMSS-Bienestarare the most accessible segment of the formal healthcare system for uninsured and marginalized populations. Unlike Tier 1 institutions, which require formal employment or institutional affiliation, Tier 2 services are publicly funded, universally available, and often serve as the default option in rural or low-resource settings. They also tend to have fewer bureaucratic requirements, making them more navigable for individuals with limited Spanish proficiency, low literacy, or unfamiliarity with state institutions. By focusing on Tier 2 care, this analysis isolates the point of divergence where monolingual Indigenous-language speakers may still be able to access institutional care, but are potentially funneled away from higher-complexity Tier 1 services due to structural and linguistic barriers. This tier thus serves as a critical middle ground—formal but accessible—allowing us to examine whether language proficiency shapes reliance on this specific type of care rather than leading individuals to forgo formal care altogether in favor of Tier 3 alternatives.\nTo reduce omitted variable bias, the model includes the following control variables: - Education level (H0317A): Ordinal variable capturing highest grade completed (no schooling to university). - Income bracket: Derived from ENSANUT’s household income sections (I and VI), capturing relative socioeconomic status. - Insurance status (H0310A): Whether the respondent has formal healthcare coverage through IMSS, ISSSTE, or other systems. - Urban/rural residence (estrato): Binary variable indicating household location type. These controls account for structural drivers of healthcare access—such as affordability, geographic proximity, and institutional affiliation—that could confound the relationship between language ability and healthcare-seeking behavior."

Focusing on Tier 2 allows us to test whether monolingual speakers are funneled into this tier as a result of structural and linguistic barriers that restrict access to Tier 1 care, without resorting to informal or alternative care sources (Tier 3).\nTo reduce omitted variable bias, the model includes the following control variables: - Education level (H0317A): Ordinal variable capturing highest grade completed (no schooling to university). - Income bracket: Derived from ENSANUT’s household income sections (I and VI), capturing relative socioeconomic status. - Insurance status (H0310A): Whether the respondent has formal healthcare coverage through IMSS, ISSSTE, or other systems. - Urban/rural residence (estrato): Binary variable indicating household location type."
