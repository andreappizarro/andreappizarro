This project was completed as a final assignment for PSCI 3200: Global Development—Intermediate Topics in Politics, Policy, and Data at the University of Pennsylvania. Conducted by Andrea Perez Pizarro, a student from Guadalajara, Mexico, the study reflects a personal and academic interest in Mexico as a critical site for global health and development research. Drawing on national survey data and data-driven methods introduced in the course, the project examines patterns of healthcare access and utilization through a development and equity lens, with a particular focus on the structural barriers facing marginalized populations. By combining quantitative analysis with insights from the fields of political economy and global development, this work aims to contribute to broader conversations about how data can be used to better understand and ultimately address inequities in health systems in middle-income countries, such as Mexico.
